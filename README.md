# NASA Explorer

A web application to explore and visualize NASA's open data using React and Node.js/Express.

## Project Structure

- `client/` - React frontend
- `server/` - Node.js + Express backend

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18+ recommended)
- npm

### Backend Setup
1. `cd server`
2. Create a `.env` file with:
   ```
   NASA_API_KEY=DEMO_KEY
   PORT=5051
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the server:
   ```
   node index.js
   ```

### Frontend Setup
1. `cd client`
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the React app:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

### Running the App
- To start both the backend and frontend concurrently, run from the root directory:
  ```
  npm run dev
  ```

## Testing

### Backend
To run the backend tests, navigate to the `server` directory and run:
```
npm test
```
This will execute the Jest test suite for the Express API.

### Frontend
To run the frontend tests, navigate to the `client` directory and run:
```
npm test
```
This will execute the Jest and React Testing Library test suite for React components.

For a single test run (non-watch mode), use:
```
npm test -- --watchAll=false
```

## Features
- **Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD):** View NASA's daily featured space image.
- **Mars Rover Photos:** Browse images from Mars rovers like Curiosity, Spirit, and Opportunity.
- **Near Earth Objects (NEOs):** Track asteroids and comets that pass close to Earth, with data visualizations.
- **NASA Media Library:** Search NASA's vast collection of images, videos, and audio.
- Responsive design with a modern, dark-themed UI.
- Interactive modals for viewing media content.

## Deployment
- **Backend:** Deployed on [Render](https://render.com/).
- **Frontend:** Deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
